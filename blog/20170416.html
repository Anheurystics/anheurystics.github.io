		<p>This is my first attempt at a blog post. I think I'll be writing things I encounter while experimenting around, tutorials,
			etc.</p>
		<p>
			Instead of using something like Wordpress (as I've done before) or using a static site generator (GitHub fervently recommends
			that I use Jekyll), I've decided to try my hand at writing these blog posts directly in HTML. That means copying a template,
			editing the text inside the tags, then pushing it to the repo.
		</p>
		<p>
			That seems like a lot of things to do, where I have to manually set up the links to the index page, the next posts, etc.,
			but honestly right now it seems to be the simplest (not necessarily the easiest) way to get my thoughts across in a static
			HTML manner. Plus, I might be writing tutorials that need images, canvasses, etc., and I'm not sure what those static
			blog site generators can offer in terms of those. I might look into those, if I can be bothered.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'll probably end up writing a highly inefficient static site generator of my own in the future, but this works for now.
